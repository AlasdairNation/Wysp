## **Running the executable on the Curtin Lab Machines and Ubuntu Systems**
1. Make sure the executable is on the desktop.
2. Set the permissions of the file to allow execution: Right click -> properties -> permissions -> "Allow executing file as program". (Sometimes needs you to turn off and on again)
3. Run as a program: Right click -> "Run as program"

Note: Booting and creating new projects can sometimes take a while.
